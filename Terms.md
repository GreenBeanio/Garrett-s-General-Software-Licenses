## Meanings

<h3 id="Commercial_Use">Commercial Use</h3>

"Commercial Use" entails that the project and it's derivatives may be used for commercial purposes. "Commercial" meaning anything involving a monetary transaction of any kind.

Specifically, monetary transactions from a customer, consumer, end user, or entity to the person or entity providing this project, or using this project, to provide products or services to the customer, consumer, end user, or entity.

Transactions applicable to monetary transactions are also included, such as labor, advertising, or services.

This provision explicitly allows a person or entity to use this project to provide a product or service to a customer, consumer, end user, or entity in exchange for something else.

If this provision is not explicitly given it means that this project can not be used to provide a product or service that requires the customer, consumer, end user, or entity to facilitate a monetary transaction with the provider. Meaning that unless this provision is given the customer, consumer, end user, or entity shall not be charged any monetary, or other costs, to use the product or service this project is used in. This includes any indirect costs to the customer, consumer, end user, or entity. Indirect costs include, but are not limited to, advertising revenue, selling of user data, or using user data for marketing or other business operations. Simply put if this provision is not explicitly granted the customer, consumer, end user, or entity shall be able to use the product or service using this project for free without any cost, be it direct or indirect.

<h3 id="Donation">Donation</h3>

"Donation" allows for the providers of a product or service using this project to collect donations. These donations can be monetary or applicable transactions such as labor, advertising, or services.

A donation must not be required from the customer, consumer, end user, or entity to use the provided product or service using this project. A donation must also not give the customer, consumer, end user, or entity special privileges or access to the product or service using this project, that a non-donator would not have. Simply, donators and non-donators must be kept equal in all aspects.

<h3 id="Distribution">Distribution</h3>

"Distribution" means that the project may be distributed to others. This includes physical, digital, network, and any other form of distribution, including those yet to be created.

"Distribution" is explicitly implied for every form of this project, this includes, but is not limited to, its raw form (such as source code), its finished form (such as binaries, executables, compiled forms, etc.), it's remote form (such as a website, hosted, cloud, or as a service versions), and anything in between, or yet to be created.

This also specifically includes having **multiple** users of the project. Such as a piece of hosted software that multiple users connect to over networks.

<h3 id="Modification">Modification</h3>

"Modification" means that this project, and it's constituent parts, may be changed or edited. This includes every element of the project.

<h3 id="Private_Use">Private Use</h3>

"Private Use" entails using the project for personal use. "Personal Use" meaning you are the **sole** user of the project. Specifically, that there is a sole user of this distinct distribution, version, or copy of the project at any given time.

However, if using a local device, or version, of the project multiple users can use the project independently. Seeing as it's no different than if they were using their own version, or borrowing yours. This does not allow for distributing the project; that needs to be explicitly allowed in another provision.

An exception to the sole user rule is if the project requires multiple users on a local device, or version, of the project. Such as, if a video game has local co-op. In that scenario the project can be used for "private use" by multiple users. Seeing as the other user does not get distributed a version, or copy, of the product to keep as their own. It was your local distribution, version, or copy of the project the entire time.

"Private Use" is analogous to having a hammer. If I have a hammer I can use it to hammer nails. If my friend comes over they can pick up my hammer and hammer nails as well, but then I can't use the hammer anymore. "Distribution" is also analogous to me having a hammer. Except, when my friend comes over instead of me letting him use my hammer I duplicate the hammer and give him the duplicate. Then we both have hammers and can hammer nails.

<h3 id="Disclose_Source">Disclose Source</h3>

"Disclose Source" means that when the project is distributed the source code must be made available.

In the event that the entire source code is not distributed alongside the form distributed the end user must be made aware in some way that they are entitled access to it as well as where they can freely, easily, and readily receive it.

<h3 id="License_and_Copyright_Notice">License and Copyright Notice</h3>

"License and Copyright Notice" means that the following should be included when this project is distributed in every form, this includes, but is not limited to, its raw form (such as source code), its finished form (such as binaries, executables, compiled forms, etc.), it's remote form (such as a website, hosted, cloud, or as a service versions), and anything in between, or yet to be created:

- A copy of this license.
- A mention of this project, the license it uses, and any other desired relevant information.

In the event that this project is distributed in its raw form, such as source code, these two items should be included as files.

In the event that the project is distributed in its finished form, such as binaries, these two items should be included alongside the finished form or located in the finished form in an easy to discover and navigate area for the end user.

In the event that this project is remote, such as a website, these two items should be located in the finished form in an easy to discover and navigate area for the end user.

Preferably, but not required, inside each file of the source code would be a comment header listing information about the copyright and the license.

Preferably, but not required, a third items would be included consisting of two things. The fist being mentions to any and every other project used within this project, the license they use, and any other desired relevant information about them. The second being information about every author, copyright holder, maintainer, or any other party who modifies the project, such as their name, contact information, and what they did on the project. It is of upmost importance to give credit to the creators of what you use.

<h3 id="Network_Use_Is_Distribution">Network Use Is Distribution</h3>

"Network Use Is Distribution" means that when a customer, consumer, end user, or entity uses, or interacts with, this project over a network it is treated as distribution. "Over a network" meaning any form of remote connection, including forms yet to be created. These remote connections include, but are not limited to, websites, servers, cloud, and as a service.

<h3 id="Same_License">Same License</h3>

"Same License" means that when using this project your **entire** project must use this license.

"Using this project" means:

- Using this project as is.
- Using this project as a component, such as a library, package, module, framework, platform, etc, in a new project.
- Making modifications to this project, such as a modified fork.

<h3 id="Existing_Project_Same_License">Existing Project Same License</h3>

"Existing Project Same License" means that when using this project your project must use the same license, but only for the original content of this project.

"Using this project" means:

- Using this project as is.
- Using this project as a component, such as a library, package, module, framework, platform, etc, in a new project.
- Making modifications to this project, such as a modified fork.

Exceptions can be made under the following situations:

1. You keep the contents of the original project as this license.
2. You use another license that is compliant and permissible with the provisions of this license for any modifications you made to this project as well as any new additions.
3. If other projects were also used as components in your project include their licenses as required in their provisions alongside this license. If their license also requires your project to use their license do as follows.
    1. If their license meets the same provisions as this license:
        1. If they allow for permissable licenses to be used then use this license.
        2. If they don't allow for permissable licenses to be used then use their license.
    2. If their license does not meet the same provisions as this license:
        1. Remove the other project as a component of your project, or remove this project as a component of your project. Both projects can not be used if they don't share the same license provisions.

<h3 id="State_Changes">State Changes</h3>

"State Changes" requires that any changes made to the project must be documented. The method to document these changes should be stored with the source code.

Preferably, this documentation would be stored in the source code itself. The verbose approach would be adding the date, author of the modification, if desired contact information, and if desired comment explaining the modification to sections modified. The brief approach would be to make an addition to a header comment including the date, the author of the modification, if desired contact information, and if desired a comment about the modification.

Version control will be accepted, but is not preferred. This is because it can easily be separated from the source code itself. An end user downloading the source code will likely not clone the repository and thusly not have access to the commit history of modifications.

Another approach would be a dedicated document listing the modification information. However, this is the most intensive for the maintainers and is not expected.

<h3 id="Liability">Liability</h3>

"Liability" means as follows:

In no event shall the authors, copyright holders, maintainers, or any other party who modifies the project, and/or conveys the project as permitted above be liable and/or held responsible for any claim, damages, including any general, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the project, or other liability, whether in action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the project, or other dealings of the project, even if the holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

<h3 id="Warranty">Warranty</h3>

"Warranty" means as follows:

This project is provided as is without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entirety of risk, including but not limited to, quality and performance of the project is entirely with you. Should any problems or damages arise you assume all costs in connection to the project or its use.
