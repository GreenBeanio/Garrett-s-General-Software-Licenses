## Provisions

<h3 id="Commercial_Use">Commercial Use</h3>

"Commercial Use" entails that the project may be used for commercial purposes. "Commercial" meaning anything involving a monetary, or other, transaction of any kind.

Specifically, monetary transactions from a customer, consumer, end user, or entity to the person or entity providing this project, or using this project, to provide products or services to the customer, consumer, end user, or entity.

Transactions applicable to monetary transactions are also included, such as labor, advertising, or services.

This provision explicitly allows a person or entity to use this project to provide a product or service to a customer, consumer, end user, or entity in exchange for something else.

If this provision is not explicitly given it means that this project can not be used to provide a product or service that requires the customer, consumer, end user, or entity to facilitate a monetary transaction with the provider. Meaning that unless this provision is given the customer, consumer, end user, or entity shall not be charged any monetary, or other, costs, to use the product or service this project is used in. This includes any indirect costs to the customer, consumer, end user, or entity. Indirect costs include, but are not limited to, advertising revenue, selling of user data, or using user data for marketing or other business operations. Simply put if this provision is not explicitly granted the customer, consumer, end user, or entity shall be able to use the product or service using this project for free without any cost, be it direct or indirect.

<h3 id="Donation">Donation</h3>

"Donation" allows for the providers of a product or service using this project to collect donations. These donations can be monetary or applicable transactions such as, but not limited to, labor, advertising, or services.

A donation must not be required from the customer, consumer, end user, or entity to use the provided product or service using this project. A donation must also not give the customer, consumer, end user, or entity special privileges or access to the product or service using this project that a non-donator would not have. Simply, donators and non-donators must be kept equal in all aspects.

<h3 id="Distribution">Distribution</h3>

"Distribution" means that the project may be distributed to others. This includes physical, digital, network, and any other form of distribution, including those yet to be created.

"Distribution" is explicitly implied for every form of this project, this includes, but is not limited to, its raw form (such as source code), its finished form (such as binaries, executables, compiled forms, etc.), it's remote form (such as a website, hosted, cloud, or as a service versions), and anything in between, or yet to be created.

This also specifically includes having **multiple** users of the project. Such as a piece of hosted software that multiple users connect to over networks.

<h3 id="Modification">Modification</h3>

"Modification" means that this project, and it's constituent parts, may be changed or edited. This includes every element of the project. If modification is not explicitly allowed the project must be used as is.

Any other project used in this project is subject to the provisions of its license, except modified parts of that project that are now using this license. Therefore there are two exceptions to this provision:

1. If modification is not explicitly allowed in this project but an included project has a license allowing for modification then the items of this project from that project can be modified according to its license.
2. If modification is explicitly allowed in this project but an included project has a license not allowing for modification then the items of this project from that project can not be modified according to its license.

<h3 id="Private_Use">Private Use</h3>

"Private Use" entails using the project for personal use. "Personal Use" meaning you are the **sole** user of the project. Specifically, that there is a sole user of this distinct distribution, version, or copy of the project at any given time.

However, if using a local device, or version, of the project multiple users can use the project independently. Seeing as it's no different than if they were using their own version, or borrowing yours. This does not allow for distributing the project; that needs to be explicitly allowed in another provision.

An exception to the sole user rule is if the project requires or facilitates multiple users on a local device, or version, of the project. Such as, if a video game has local co-op. In that scenario the project can be used for "private use" by multiple users. Seeing as the other user does not get distributed a version, or copy, of the product to keep as their own. It was your local distribution, version, or copy of the project the entire time.

"Private Use" is analogous to having a hammer. If I have a hammer I can use it to hammer nails. If my friend comes over they can pick up my hammer and hammer nails as well, but then I can't use the hammer anymore. "Distribution" is also analogous to me having a hammer. Except, when my friend comes over instead of me letting him use my hammer I duplicate the hammer and give him the duplicate. Then we both have hammers and can hammer nails.

<h3 id="Disclose_Source">Disclose Source</h3>

"Disclose Source" means that when the project is distributed the source code must be made available.

In the event that the entire source code is not distributed alongside the form distributed the end user must be made aware, in some easily visible and navigable way, that they are entitled access to it as well as where they can freely, easily, and readily receive it.

This "easily visible and navigable way" can be any method that meshes well with your use case. It should be in such a way that the customer, consumer, end user, or entity using your product or service is made readily aware that the source code is available if they desire it. Some, but not all, examples of this are as follows: Part of a splash screen, prominent in the documentation or manual, a easily navigable page on a website, and a notice message confirmed by the user.

<h3 id="License_and_Copyright_Notice">License and Copyright Notice</h3>

"License and Copyright Notice" means that the following should be included when this project is distributed in every form, this includes, but is not limited to, its raw form (such as source code), its finished form (such as binaries, executables, compiled forms, etc.), it's remote form (such as a website, hosted, cloud, or as a service versions), and anything in between, or yet to be created:

- A copy of this license.
- A mention of this project, the license it uses, and any other desired relevant information.

In the event that this project is distributed in its raw form, such as source code, these two items should be included as files.

In the event that the project is distributed in its finished form, such as binaries, these two items should be included alongside the finished form or located in the finished form in an easy to discover and navigate area for the end user.

In the event that this project is remote, such as a website, these two items should be located in the finished form in an easy to discover and navigate area for the end user.

Preferably, but not required, inside each file of the source code would be a header comment listing information about the copyright and the license.

Preferably, but not required, would be two other items included along side the required other two:

1. Mentions to any and all other projects used within this project, the license they use, and any other desired relevant and/or required information about them.
    - It is respectful to give credit to the projects that you used to create your project.
    - Given that many projects have licenses requiring this information to be recorded it is always a good idea to include this information.

2. Information about every author, copyright holder, maintainer, or any other party who modifies the project, such as their name, contact information, and what they did on the project.
    - It is of upmost importance to give credit to the creators and maintainers of what you use.
    - It would also be respectful to not include those who don't want their information published.
    - However, due to the large and collaborative nature of many open-source projects this may not, and often will not, be feasible. In that case it would be respectful to at least give references to the key figures and the community in general.

<h3 id="Network_Use_Is_Distribution">Network Use Is Distribution</h3>

"Network Use Is Distribution" means that when a customer, consumer, end user, or entity uses, or interacts with, this project over a network it is treated as distribution. "Over a network" meaning any form of remote connection, including forms yet to be created. These remote connections include, but are not limited to, websites, servers, the cloud, and as a service.

<h3 id="Same_License">Same License</h3>

"Same License" means that when using this project your **entire** project must use this license.

"Using this project" means:

- Using this project as is.
- Using this project as a component, such as a library, package, module, framework, platform, etc, in a new project.
- Making modifications to this project, such as a modified fork.

If other projects were also used as components in your project follow these rules:
    1. If their license satisfies the provisions of this license:
        1. If they allow for permissable licenses to be used then use this license.
        2. If they don't allow for permissable licenses then either remove the other project as a component of your project, or remove this project as a component of your project. This license must be used for the entirety of your project. If the other project's license does not allow for permissable licenses it can not be used in this project alongside this project, even if the two licenses satisfy each other's provisions.
    2. If their license does not satisfy the provisions of this license:
        1. Remove the other project as a component of your project, or remove this project as a component of your project. Both projects can not be used if they don't share the same license provisions.

<h3 id="Existing_Project_Same_License">Existing Project Same License</h3>

"Existing Project Same License" means that when using this project your project must use the same license, but only for the original content of this project.

"Using this project" means:

- Using this project as is.
- Using this project as a component, such as a library, package, module, framework, platform, etc, in a new project.
- Making modifications to this project, such as a modified fork.

Exceptions can be made under the following situations:

1. You keep the contents of the original project as this license.
2. You use another license that is compliant, permissible, and satisfies the provisions of this license for any modifications you made to the original contents of this project.
    -original: 2. You use another license that is compliant, permissible, and satisfies the provisions of this license for any modifications you made to this project as well as any new additions.
3. If other projects were also used as components in your project include their licenses as required in their provisions alongside this license. If their license also requires your project to use their license do as follows:
    1. If their license satisfies the provisions of this license:
        1. If they allow for permissable licenses to be used use this license.
        2. If they don't allow for permissable licenses to be used use their license.
    2. If their license does not satisfy the provisions of this license:
        1. Remove the other project as a component of your project, or remove this project as a component of your project. Both projects can not be used if they don't satisfy each other's license provisions.

<h3 id="State_Changes">State Changes</h3>

"State Changes" requires that any changes made to the project must be documented. The method to document these changes should be stored with the source code.

Preferably, this documentation would be stored in the source code itself. The verbose approach would be adding the date, author of the modification, if desired contact information, and if desired comment explaining the modification to sections modified. The brief approach would be to make an addition to a header comment including the date, the author of the modification, if desired contact information, and if desired a comment about the modification.

Version control will be accepted, but is not preferred. This is because it can easily be separated from the source code itself. An end user downloading the source code will likely not clone the repository and thusly not have access to the commit history of modifications.

Another approach would be a dedicated document listing the modification information. However, this is the most intensive for the maintainers and is not expected.

<h3 id="Liability">Liability</h3>

"Liability" means as follows:

In no event shall the authors, copyright holders, maintainers, or any other party who modifies the project, and/or conveys the project as permitted above be liable and/or held responsible for any claim, damages, including any general, special, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the project, or other liability, whether in action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the project, or other dealings of the project, even if the holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

<h3 id="Warranty">Warranty</h3>

"Warranty" means as follows:

This project is provided as is without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entirety of risk, including but not limited to, quality and performance of the project is entirely with you. Should any problems or damages arise you assume all costs in connection to the project or its use.
